# 🎬 Netflix Data Analysis Project (SQL)

This project showcases a detailed analysis of Netflix titles using SQL. The dataset includes information about movies and TV shows, such as cast, ratings, release years, durations, and more. The goal is to derive meaningful insights from the data using structured SQL queries.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Explore and clean the Netflix dataset
- Use SQL to answer business-relevant questions
- Apply filtering, grouping, subqueries, and aggregation to draw insights
- Practice real-world SQL querying techniques on a streaming dataset

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview

The dataset includes:
- **Title** – Name of the movie/show
- **Type** – Movie or TV Show
- **Cast** – Featured actors
- **Rating** – Maturity rating (e.g., PG, TV-MA)
- **Release Year**
- **Duration** – Length of content
- **Country**, **Genre**, and more

📁 Source: Public Netflix Dataset (CSV format)

## 📌 Learnings

* Filtering data using `WHERE`, `ILIKE`, and `IN`
* Grouping and aggregating with `GROUP BY`, `COUNT()`, `MAX()`, `AVG()`
* Using subqueries and nested conditions
* Performing real-time analytical thinking with SQL
